					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Restate the challenge of the lab here.</p>
					<p>This lab teaches us about how the input text bxo works and how to create events.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
					<p>A problem arose that I wanted to print it out in my results section. I wanted to learn how to add Javascript variables so I ended up searching that up.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					<p>I think this assignment and the last lab could've been blended together and created shorter, as it felt repetitive and tedious. However, I still put in a lot of effort.</p>
