					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					<p>I think this assignment was very basic, yet very much needed, as it is important for us to organize
						files to help us and other people looking at our project. It was done quite easily, but I still tried to put  a lot of effort into 
						making my website more unique.
