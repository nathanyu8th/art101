					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Restate the challenge of the lab here.</p>
					<p>The challenge of the lab is to learn about HTML, CSS, and javascript
						to the point where we can become proficient in using these languages.
					</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
					<p>At times when we were coding, there were some erros regarding HTML and CSS, whether it be forgetting semi-colons or not knowing how to change something. We fixed this
						by searching on google for how to fix our errors, in addition to learning new facts about the languages.

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					<p>I think this assignment was much needed for us, as many students, including me, didn't know much on how to use these coding languages.
						However, this tutorial made the assignment go fairly well, being pretty straightforward, albeit confusing at times. My partner and I both tried to put a lot of energy to make the website more creative than usual, searching up certain things we could do with the CSS file.
