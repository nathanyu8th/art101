  Print the board before every turn
    Make changes to the board regarding player moves
  Accept User Input
    Reveal possible moves for the piece that the player chooses
  Execute User Input
    Move pieces after user confirms their move
    If the piece can make any more moves, let the player move that piece again.
    If not, end the players turn
  Create Possible Player Moves
    Make the simple checkers piece able to only move forward
    If the piece reaches the end of the board, promote it
