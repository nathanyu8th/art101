					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Restate the challenge of the lab here.</p>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to learn pseudocode in order to better help us take on challenges. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
					<p>There were some problems in writing down lists and figuring out which steps were actually needed. This was solved by collaborating with each other and critically thinking about the steps.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					<p>I think this assignment was tedious, but unfortunately for the wrong reasons. However, I do think that learning pseudocode is very important for future programmers, but I was left tired after this assignment.</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output"></div>
					<h3>This is Task 1, where we have pseudocode for how to make a PB&J sandwich, including substeps.</h3>
					<p>
						<pre><code>
Task 1:
	Making a PB&J Sandwich
		Getting Ingredients and Tools
			Bread
			Peanut Butter
			Jelly
			Spreading Knife
		Putting the Sauces on the Bread
			Use the Spreading Knife
			Gather jelly on the knife, and spread it on the first slice of bread.
			Gather Peanut Butter on the knife, and spread it on the second slice of bread. 
		Creating the Sandwich
			Combine both the slices of bread with the ingredients facing towards each other.

					<h3>This is Task 1, where we have pseudocode for how to make the game Checkers, including substeps.</h3>
					<p>
						<pre><code>
//Pseudocode
/*
Task 2:
Checkers
  Print the board before every turn
    Make changes to the board regarding player moves
  Accept User Input
    Reveal possible moves for the piece that the player chooses
  Execute User Input
    Move pieces after user confirms their move
    If the piece can make any more moves, let the player move that piece again.
    If not, end the players turn
  Create Possible Player Moves
    Make the simple checkers piece able to only move forward
    If the piece reaches the end of the board, promote it
    The piece can now move forwards and backwards
  Program AI for the Computer
    Set up a neural network for the AI
    Feed it hundreds of test data from previous checkers games found online.
    Create 3 different difficulties
      Make different settings for each bot
  Make the win condition
    If a player loses all their pieces, they lose and the other player wins
    If neither player can move, then it`s a draw
  Create UI
    Make the possible moves bright to make it noticeable to the player
    When the game ends, show the player`s result
      Show 2 buttons
        Play Again
        Go Back to Title
